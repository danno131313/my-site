            <p>Hi, my name is Daniel Kavanagh and I'm a software developer specializing in full stack web development in Bellingham, WA.</p>
            <p>I've been programming since I was was 14, when I started tweaking values in Lua game files. From then on it has always been a part of my life, and I discovered I had a real passion for it. Now I write code for a living, and it's truly a dream job!</p>
